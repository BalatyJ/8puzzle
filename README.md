# 8puzzle
CS331 Programming Project for 8Puzzle.

* Programming assignment for CS 331 at OSU for 8Puzzle assignment. Incorporates A* search algorithm using 3 different heuristics along with BFS to find the shortest number of turns needed to solve the 8Puzzle.

* A* Search was built using Python with a heapq min heap to store nodes/actions to be checked.

* Designed a report utilizing MatPlotLib for graphs that compared the performance of different admissible heuristics, including the number of actions explored, the time needed to solve the 8Puzzle, and the found solution to a non-admissible heuristicâ€™s stats.

* Also includes graphs and an analysis of the performance of the heuristics used for A* search in the pdf.
